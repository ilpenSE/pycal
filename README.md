# Evaluator
`calculator.py` file is an evaluator. Python has its own evaluator but this evaluator is more advanced. It supports nth roots, logarithms and trigo. Usage of those functions was given in that file but it's in Turkish. Here's the English version:
- pi: Returns π number and can be used in functions
- e: Returns e number and can be used in functions
- phi: Returns φ number (golden ratio) and can be used in functions
- sin(x): Calculates sine of x in radians
- cos(x): Calculates cosine of x in radians
- tan(x): Calculates tangent of x in radians
- cot(x): Calculates cotangent of x in radians
- sec(x): Calculates secant of x in radians
- csc(x): Calculates cosecant of x in radians
- arcsin(x): Calculates reverse sine of x
- arccos(x): Calculates reverse cosine of x
- arctan(x): Calculates reverse tangent of x
- arccot(x): Calculates reverse cotangent of x
- arcsec(x): Calculates reverse secant of x
- arccsc(x): Calculates reverse cosecant of x
- log(x): Calculates the logarithm of x in base 10
- log(x, n): Calculates the logarithm of x in base n
- ln(x): Calculates the natural logarithm of x
- üs(x, y): Calculates x to the power of y
- kök(x): Calculates square root of x
- nkök(n, x): Calculates nth root of x
- You can use this in exponentiation: `x**y` (x to the power of y) These operations can be used in functions: `log(100)**2` (=4)
# Irrational Calculator
`irrcal.py` file is a calculator that allows you to calculate a number's square root or how many digits of pi, e, phi based on a specific sensitivity. (You can change it) It supports Turkish, English, German and French; thus, you can go to the file and take a look how to use it.
